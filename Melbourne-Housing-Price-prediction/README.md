### Project Overview

 Identifying housing price using Melbourne House DataSet .


### Learnings from the project

 Using Linear Regression to predict continuous variable and using Ridge and Lasso Regularization techniques to optimize the model prediction


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used LinearRegression to predict and to optimize further i used Ridge and Lasso regression technique to compare which regularization works better
