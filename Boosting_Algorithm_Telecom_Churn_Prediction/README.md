### Project Overview

 Using Boosting Algorithm like Adaboost and Xgboost to analyse and predict telecom Churn and check performance using accuracy score , confusion matrix (recall,precision)


### Learnings from the project

 - Using  Sklearn.Ensemble Package
- Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values in data
- Applying AdaBoost
- Applying XGBoost
-Applying GridSearchCV on xgboost
- Interpreting evaluation metrics (Accuracy Score,  Confusion Matrix)

Outcome: Adaboost and Xboost doesnt gave better accuracy score . Xgboost on GridSearchCV gave better accuracy score.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I tried two Algorithms AdaBoost and Xgboost :

Steps :
1) Data Clean
2) Data Processing
3) Intialize Adaboost / Xgboost  Classifier
4) Fit and predict
5) check accuracy score and classification report
