### Project Overview

 Used Logistic Regression for Supervised Learning Model.  It Includes bifurcation of test, train dataset. Checking precision, accuracy and F-score


### Learnings from the project

 The outcome teached me a lot how logistic regression works . and learnt some technical jargons like accuracy, roc-auc score, min-max scaling, standardizing model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 My approach was research based. kind of reverse engineering . learn to implement logistic regression then break down small things to learn how a particular thing is useful


### Challenges faced

 Research is what that took most of the time. Finding proper information in easily understandable language is always time consuming
