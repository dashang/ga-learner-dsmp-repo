### Project Overview

 Using Decision Trees to Test and Predict DataSet


### Learnings from the project

 - Train-test split
- Correlation between the features
- Decision Tree Modeling
- Evaluation Metrics
- Graphviz plotting


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Using Decision Tree model  classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 


### Challenges faced

 none


### Additional pointers

 Decision Tree is good algorithm for classification type problems. But main disadvantage of DT's is it learns training dataSet very good which leads to Overfitting . Hence we can use pruning to avoid Overfitting
