### Project Overview

 Using Linear Regression to predict continous variable


### Learnings from the project

 Usage of Linear Regression to predict data for continous variable .  using OLS method to minimize the sum of square differences between the observed and predicted values and using RMSE to check for better performance of model


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Initializing the Linear Regression model and using training data and making model to fit with training data with ytrain data and making prediction using pred() and checking rmse for performance


### Challenges faced

 I did some research and got the hurdle solved
